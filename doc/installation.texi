Guile-INI sources are available from GitHub at
@url{https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ini/}. This section describes
requirements of Guile-INI and installation process.

Guile-INI depends on the following packages:

@itemize
@item @url{https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/, GNU Guile}, 2.2 or later
@item @url{https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-smc/, Guile-SMC}
@end itemize

Get the sources of Guile-INI from GitHub using Git (a good introduction to Git
is @url{https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2, Pro Git} book, which is available
online):

@example
$ git clone https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ini.git
@end example

Configure the sources:

@example
$ cd guile-ini/
$ autoreconf -vif
$ ./configure
@end example

Build and install the library:

@example
$ make
$ make install
@end example

For a basic explanation of the installation of the package, see the
@file{INSTALL} file.

@strong{important} You probably want to call @command{configure} with
the @option{--with-guilesitedir} option so that this package is
installed in Guile's default path.  But, if you don't know where your
Guile site directory is, run @command{configure} without the option,
and it will give you a suggestion.
